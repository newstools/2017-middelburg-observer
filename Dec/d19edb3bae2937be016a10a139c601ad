According to information, three adults, two women and a man, were killed in the collision. Initial information was that the accident was caused when one of the vehicles involved attempted to make a u-turn on the high way. A person on the scene speculated that one of the truck’s tyres burst causing it to swerve into the oncoming lane, in front of the Forturner.  Three more people sustained serious injuries and a further two were slightly injured. All the occupants injured were travelling in the Fortuner. Rain was said to be a contributing factor in the cause of the accident.  TRAC  has said on Twitter that the road is currently closed and alternative routes should be considered.
