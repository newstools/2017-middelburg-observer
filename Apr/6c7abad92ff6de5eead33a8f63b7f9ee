The municipal tariff for water could jump by 10,75% by July this year according to a budget tabled by the Steve Tshwete Municipality at a Special Council Meeting held last week.The cost of water supplying surrounding towns and villages around Middelburg had increased and the water price increase was to subsidize these areas as the municipality charges a flat rate to all residents. The new budget also includes the following tariff increases: Property rates 6,1% Sewerage 7,6% Refuse removal 6,9% Water 10,75% Electricity 1,88%The new budget is now open for inspections but it is only effective from 1 July. Residents can give inputs on the budget and the IDP, after which a council meeting will be held to consider any changes and thereafter approve.
