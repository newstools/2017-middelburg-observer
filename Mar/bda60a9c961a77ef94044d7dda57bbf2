A woman witnessed the ordeal whilst taking a smoke-break outside her workplace in Cowen Ntuli Street near the traffic light at the Lilian Ngoyi T-junction.She said that a woman with short blond hair, estimated to be in her 40 s and driving a white Kia SUV, simply threw the kitten out the window whilst driving down the busy street before turning into the shopping complex next to McDonald s, where Roman s Pizza is situated.The witness ran into the street to rescue the kitten before it could be hit by a car.The cat had all the skin and hair of its tail removed with eyewitnesses saying it resembled the tail of a rat.The animal also had an injury to its eye and internal injuries to its hips, later discovered when it was taken to the vet.One of the women working close to where the incident happened, has since adopted the cat and also paid for its medical bills.Anyone who has witnessed the event or know who the culprit might be, is requested to phone the Middelburg Observer standby number on 072 248 3855.
