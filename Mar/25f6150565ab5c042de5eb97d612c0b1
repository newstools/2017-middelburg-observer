Numerous drivers were at first shocked to learn that they were no longer receiving the discount and were charged full amounts which were deducted off their accounts.Solange Soares-Nicholson, Communications Manager at TRAC, said that all motorists were informed a month ago that the system would be in place as of 1 March 2017 and were advised accordingly.&#8220;Motorists who wish to receive a refund may take it up with SANRAL, who have issued e-tags,&#8221; she said. Motorists with an e-tag should ensure that their account is always topped up.&#8220;For motorists with no e-tag, nothing has changed&#8221;. Account holders can simply visit the mainline plaza they are affiliated to, taking along their 16 digit automated electronic tag number, and request the linkage. TRAC&#8217;s mainline plazas are: Diamond Hill Plaza Middelburg Plaza Machado Plaza Nkomazi Plaza.For more information on the automated electronic payment system visit www.nra.co.za or contact the SANRAL Call Centre on 0800 726 725.
