Ms Stuurman says that when confronted, the inyanga admitted to being sent by her sister-in-law, Elsie Masemola. I installed the CCTV cameras after making strange findings in my yard almost every day, she said. I knew I was the target of someone s evil intentions. Last Wednesday night, at about 23:30, the cameras filmed the inyanga as he loomed from the shadows, tossing muthi into Sesi s yard.The next morning Sesi and her son viewed the footage and identified the inyanga who lived nearby.&nbsp;
