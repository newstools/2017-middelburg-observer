This follows Siphamandla s death more than a week ago, three months after he was left paralysed due to a beating allegedly by the principal of Manyano Primary School in Mhluzi.Christina told the Middelburg Observer that when her child was at Middelburg Hospital, he suddenly took a bad turn, started to vomit a yellow substance, and became bloated. His health just suddenly deteriorated. I can t help but suspect that he was maybe poisoned in hospital as part of a cover up to protect the principal who works for government, after all. Christina said that she maintains that nothing was wrong with her son before the beating.Siphamandla s funeral takes place this Sunday at their hometown of Gamasha in Limpopo.Read previous stories here:Siphamandla &#8216;died of cancer&#8217;This was also published in a previous story.Media frenzy over paralyzed studentUpdate: Headmaster remains suspended We ve received some help from the municipality and from the community, but there s still many costs we have to cover on our own.
