The date is being disputed.A date displayed on the photo, shows 7 September, the date the defense allege the incident took place.

He said he ran home as soon as his legs permitted him to do so.Gibbs said that if the court finds that the photo of Mlotshwa was taken prior to the coffin incident, despite them arguing otherwise, he still does not see any evidence of the vicious assault Mlotshwa testified to.

He said he carried no knowledge of their alleged threat.Gibbs &#8220;To deter, scare you off and to make sure you do not act on your threats, and to deter you from stealing again and to admit from who you stole the cable, that is why they placed you in the coffin.&#8221;&#8220;Your version is unlikely in the extreme. You testified that they suddenly started chasing you whilst you were standing next to the road and assaulted you without saying a word.&#8221;Gibbs asked Mlotshwa to look at the video again, and to point out any visible injuries.Also read:Day two coffin case trial continuesVideo: #Coffincase Inspection of locationDay two of coffin case trial about to start in MiddelburgSecond day of Coffin Case trial set to startFollow us on Facebook and Twitter for more updates as it happens&nbsp;&nbsp;
