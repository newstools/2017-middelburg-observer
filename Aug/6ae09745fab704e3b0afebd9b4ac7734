Mlotshwa denied Oosthuyzen&#8217;s version of events that he ran away when beckoned to come closer and that Jackson&#8217;s help was called in to apprehend him.Oosthuyzen allege that Mlotshwa tried to hit him with a knobkierrie with a steel end and that he threw away a bag containing stripped copper cable before he was apprehended.Both accused allege that Mlotshwa helped them offload the coffin from Jackson&#8217;s vehicle and load it again after the ordeal.Adv. Gibbs said that Mlotshwa can be heard in the video saying that the cable belongs to him.Adv. Org Basson, on behalf of Jackson, said that he finds it funny that Mlotshwa can recall six instances of brutal assault but cannot remember what was said whilst he was in the coffin.&#8220;As soon as something does not suit your version, you strike a blank.&#8221;Adv. Basson also said that Mlotshwa&#8217;s testimony of being assaulted by the knobkierrie seems unlikely.Mlotshwa said he still had marks on his back but did not want to show the court or counsel in private. Basson said that the marks are not mentioned on the medical report.The defense also made reference to Mlotshwa&#8217;s testimony that his nose was bleeding and his right eye swollen from an assault before he was placed in the coffin. They claimed that such injuries would be visible on the video and the photo handed in as evidence.Constable Margaret Bahula, the investigating officer, is next on the stand.
