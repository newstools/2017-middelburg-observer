They were also found guilty of attempted murder, kidnapping, intimidation and defeating the administration of justice.The only count the accused was found not guilty on was that of the illegal possession of a firearm.The family of the accused sat huddled together in a packed court room after hearing the verdict. Oosthuyzen&#8217;s wife shoulders shook as she silently cried.Stateprosecutor, advocate Robert Molokoane, requested for Oosthuyzen and Jackson to be taken back into custody after being found guilty.He said that the state fears for the safety of the accused and they would be better off in custody. Adv Molokoane also said that since they have been found guilty, the accused might be tempted to not return for their sentencing court date.Judge Mphahlele, after adjourning for a couple of minutes, concluded that the accused be granted further bail. She said that they have attended all their court date, have never been late and is willing to take responsibility for their own safety.The matter has been postponed until 23 October for sentencing procedures.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
