 The Middelburg SPCA were notified of the strange behavior of a goose, who lived at the Athlone dam. It was jumping around on one foot and could not walk normally. The male goose could not keep up with the rest of his family. “He was the father of two chicks, but he could not swim properly. The babies could not understand why their father could not keep up with them,” said an eyewitness.

The photos did not bode well for the bird. According to Dr Leon Connoway,  local veterinarian, the fishing line has already damaged the birds legs, tendons and muscles and was cutting into the bone.  It was determined that the leg could not be saved and advised that the bird be euthanized. “Humans are the cruelest species on earth. This is the cause of people carelessly leaving behind fishing linen after a day at the dam. We picked up bundles and bundles of fishing line,” said senior inspector Petro Oberholzer of the Middelburg SPCA.
