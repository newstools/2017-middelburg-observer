 The medicinal use of garlic was well documented by all the major civilisations including the Egyptian, Babylonian, Greek, Roman, Chinese and Indian.  Garlic contains a compound called allicin, which has potent medicinal properties. Allicen is produced by chopping or crushing garlic which stimulates the enzymatic process that converts the phytonutrient alliin into allicin, a compound to which many of garlic’s health benefits are attributed. In order to allow for maximal allicin production, wait at least five minutes before eating or cooking the garlic. Garlic is very rich in Vitamin C, Vitamin B6 and Manganese. It also contains trace amounts of various other nutrients. Studies have found that a high dose of garlic extract (2.56 grams per day) can reduce the number of days sick with cold or flu by 60 percent.  High doses of garlic appear to improve blood pressure. In some cases, supplementation can be as effective as regular medications. The amount of allicin needed for this is equivalent to about four cloves of garlic per day. Garlic supplementation seems to reduce total and LDL cholesterol, particularly in those who have high cholesterol. HDL cholesterol and triglycerides do not seem to be affected. Oxidative damage from free radicals contributes to the aging process. Garlic contains antioxidants that protect against cell damage and ageing. It contains antioxidants that support the body’s protective mechanisms against oxidative damage. The combined effects of reducing cholesterol and blood pressure, as well as the antioxidant properties of garlic, may help prevent brain diseases like Alzheimer’s disease and dementia.
