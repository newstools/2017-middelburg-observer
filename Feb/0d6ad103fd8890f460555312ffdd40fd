The incident occurred about 19:00 in Marmer Street when the victim was parking his car.He has been identified as Marshal Kobie &#8211; a well known Nigerian who has a cellphone repair business in town and has been described as &#8220;notorious&#8221; by those who know him.An eyewitness, who asked not to be named, said that two men approached the house and took out what seemed to be a small caliber firearm.Marshal was shot twice. One bullet hit his knee and another missed. The suspects then ran towards a white Polo with no number plates and fled the area.&#8220;If they wanted to kill him they could&#8217;ve easily done so, but this for me was more of a warning,&#8221; the eyewitness said.A neighbour rushed to Marshal&#8217;s assistance and stopped the bleeding until paramedics arrived. He was then taken to hospital by ER24.Residents in the area said on Monday morning that the white Polo was seen the whole week in the vicinity of Bloekomsig, and it now makes sense as the suspects were probably waiting for the most opportune moment.Ms Toetie Kruger, who also stays in the area, said that she was sitting on the stoep with her six year old grandchild when she heard the gunshots.Seconds after the second shot was fired, Ms Kruger saw two men, with dark coloured overalls on, ran into the field. A white Polo followed shortly afterwards speeding in the street.&#8220;Ms Kobie (Marshal&#8217;s wife) jumped out of the car and ran after them, screaming.&#8221;She later told Ms Kruger that she was sitting at the back of the car with their three children. Marshall was driving and his brother was sitting in front in the passenger seat.Marshal climbed out to open the gate, when someone patted him on the shoulder. When he turned around, he was shot in the knee. A second shot was fired, but it missed him.Ms Kruger also saw how another resident (who do not want to be named) ran down the street to help Marshal.The suspect who shot Marshal has been described as a person with Rasta hair and a goatee beard.Ms Kruger called the police and ambulance services. While they were waiting, a few members of CPF/Zello arrived.&#8220;When they did not arrive after a few minutes, I called the ambulance service and police again and told them to come quickly, because the man is in a lot of pain.&#8221;She also said that the suspects did not shoot to kill, but rather as a warning.The Middelburg SAPS confirmed the incident and according to their report police were on the lookout for three suspects.&#8220;A case of attempted murder was opened and is being investigated,&#8221; said Warrant Officer Lize de Witt.On Monday morning, family members of Marshal said that he was still recovering in Hospital and was in a stable condition.He was taken to Pretoria over the weekend to remove the bullet which was embedded deep in his knee, and is now back at Middelburg Hospital.Read other news here:ChineseGepeupelreg lei tot moordArmed robber shot at e Mhluzi MallConspiracy to rob studio 88Sikloon is op pad!Tracers kroeg vroegoggend deur inbrekers geteikenVIDEO: Die voete dans by Platform Re nieStolen car chased on highway
