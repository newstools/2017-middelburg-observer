The resident, who wishes to remain anonymous says that his trust exceeded his better judgement because of the believable spiel, in which the Steve Tshwete Municipality plays a central role.The complainant says he was phoned on the morning of 11 February by a Mr Jameson, who inquired whether the complainant was aware of the 24 % electricity price hike, and that replacing his billing system with a prepaid one, could be financially beneficial.Mr Jameson told the pensioner that the municipality had implemented an online pre-paid service, and that a municipal team was tasked with identifying certain pensioners who qualify for installation rebates.For a registration fee of R550, the complainant would receive a pre-paid electricity meter for R5000, reduced from R9600.Installation of the meter would cost the complainant only R600, and the package would come with a free solar roof panel, to reduce billable electricity usage.Sometime after, a woman named Amanda phoned the complainant thrice, to inquire whether a municipal official, named Kyle, had arrived to formalize the discount deal.Kyle later arrived at the pensioner&#8217;s doorstep and requested copies of the complainant&#8217;s municipal accounts and ID.&#8220;According to Kyle I qualified and I proceeded handing him the R550 registration fee, without asking for his credentials, or a receipt,&#8221; the complainant says.Kyle left with a promise of a detailed email summary of benefits by no later than the 13th.&#8220;I&#8217;ve received nothing,&#8221; the pensioner says, adding that he would like to warn other residents of the scam.Read other stories here:Nuusflits: Belfast inwoner dood na beweerde gesinsgeweld Vrou met dood gedreigPa en seun oorleef ongelukGepeupelreg lei tot moordArmed robber shot at e Mhluzi MallConspiracy to rob studio 88Sikloon is op pad!
