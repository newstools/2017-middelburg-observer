Although this may cause temporary hindrances to road users, the long term benefits far outweigh the short term inconvenience as such road improvements result in a safer, easier-to-use highway.The upgrade of the N4 between Middelburg and Wonderfontein is still on schedule with the entire project expected to be concluded in April this year. Despite the extensive expansion being undertaken in this area, construction has not had any significant, negative effect on traffic, with only occasional, and sporadic, daytime closures occurring.Another section of the N4 toll road under major construction is the Elandsvalley section between Crossroads (just after the Schoemanskloof split) and the Montrose falls T-junction.The first phase of this project has seen approximately 20km s of pavement and 20 structures rehabilitated. Due to the topography of the area traffic flow has been affected with permanent Stop/Go s in operation.With the first phase of the project approaching completion, the second phase of Section 6E will soon take off.Tenders have been received and reviewed and the contract is expected to commence in March.This phase, which will run between Malaga Hotel and the Montrose T-junction, will see the pavement rehabilitated in three non-consecutive sections ranging between 10km 12km per section. Although the topography in this area is not as challenging, it is still unclear whether permanent Stop/Go s will be implemented.The entire Elandsvalley project is expected to be completed at the end of 2018 and TRAC is confident that it will make this portion of its 570km route easier and more convenient to use.The section between Hectorspruit and Komatipoort is also under rehabilitation with the pavement currently being rehabilitated and passing lanes being added. In order to prevent major traffic disruptions en route to the Lebombo Border Post a permanent contraflow is in effect.The speed limit has been reduced to 60km with temporary speed humps in place for speed control measures. This project is expected to be completed by August 2017.Being Southern Africa s sole cross-border concessionaire, TRAC also does extensive rehabilitation and upgrading in the Mozambican side of the route.The next section planned for rehabilitation in Mozambique is Section 16 between Ressano Garcia and Moamba. Roadworks will include the rehabilitation of the road as well as six bridges, including the Moamba interchange.Construction is due to commence soon and road users should note that due to the nature of the roadworks, traffic disruptions will unfortunately occur as Stop/Go s will be in place throughout the construction period.Read other news here:Wie is wie in misdaadgeveg?Beware of pre -paid power scammersNuusflits: Belfast inwoner dood na beweerde gesinsgeweld Vrou met dood gedreigPa en seun oorleef ongelukGepeupelreg lei tot moord&nbsp;
