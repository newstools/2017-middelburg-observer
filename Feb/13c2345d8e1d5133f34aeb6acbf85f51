The allegations stem from Natalie Koch of D sseldorf in Germany, who told www.mobserver.co.za this week that the Mayor and her delegation flew business class and were chauffeured to various destinations and from pillar to post, by two mini-buses ordered just for them. I treated them with the utmost respect and they had a wonderful time in our company, but we were betrayed. They trashed the place, did not pay bills and severely tarnished the reputation of the South African people, said Natalie. They really disgraced the name of South Africa and the Province of Mpumalanga.&#8221;Natalie also confirmed that they have made an application to the German Foreign Affairs in Berlin to have them blacklisted from all future travels into any European Country for investment opportunities in Europe. We have also informed the South African Embassy in Berlin of their misbehaviour in this respect, stated Natalie.Nkangala spokesperson David Masombuka acknowledged receipt of an enquiry by www.mobserver.co.za asking the Mayor Linah Malatjie to respond and comment on the allegations.He promised that a full response would be received during the day on Wednesday. See the Middelburg Observer Friday edition, for full details and response to the story.Read other news here:Flowers for Sue &#8211; Dullstroom community in mourning Don t be afraid my darling The horror of a farm attackVrou in koma na Dullstroom aanvalPlaasaanval bakkie gevindNuusflits: Belfast inwoner dood na beweerde gesinsgeweld Weather for the weekendVrou met dood gedreigPa en seun oorleef ongelukGepeupelreg lei tot moordArmed robber shot at e Mhluzi MallConspiracy to rob studio 88Sikloon is op pad!
