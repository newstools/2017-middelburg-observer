 Vitamin D is an important micronutrient with major health benefits, including improved immunity and stronger bones. It is a fat-soluble vitamin that you can get from vitamin D-rich foods, supplements or sun exposure. Few people are able to meet their vitamin D requirements through sun exposure alone.  There is no “one size fits all” approach. Research shows that the dosage should be based on body weight. Vitamin D supplements can cause toxicity when consumed in large amounts. Consult your doctor who will probably suggest a blood test to determine whether you are vitamin D deficient and the correct dosage.
