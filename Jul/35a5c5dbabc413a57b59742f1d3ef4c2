The owner of Tracers, Isabelle Rabie, says that her security camera shows how a front window was kicked out by a man at 03:30.The man enters and walks directly to a fridge where one of the bar-ladies hid her savings in a bottle.He also takes a large amount of alcohol from behind the counter before leaving.An hour later two men walk by and notice the broken window.One enters the the pub and takes a laptop and alcohol.The laptop was later found at Cash Crusaders and a suspect, with a bag containing bottles of alcohol, in his possession.
