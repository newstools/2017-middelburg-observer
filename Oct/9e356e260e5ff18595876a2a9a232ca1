 At an induction ceremony dubbed Knight of Hope, Golfing legend Gary Player will be inducted into the South African Hall of Fame at Sun City’s iconic Superbowl at Sun Central on 6 November 2017. Nicknamed the Black Knight, Mr. Fitness, and the International Ambassador of Golf, Player is also a renowned golf course architect with more than 325 design projects on ﬁve continents throughout the world, including the Gary Player Golf Course and the Lost City Golf Course at Sun City.  Rob Collins, Chief Strategy and Marketing Officer Sun International said: “Player, one of South Africa’s most celebrated sportspeople, businessmen and humanitarians, is indeed a most decorous icon to be incorporated into the South African Hall of Fame Powered by Samsung. We are honoured to host the induction ceremony in the lead up to the 2017 Nedbank Golf Challenge which plays out on the Gary Player Country Club golf course for the 36th time in November.” The Hall of Fame at Sun Central is a state-of-the-art interactive exhibition space that celebrates the achievements of South Africa’s legends.   Located at Sun City’s world class entertainment and convention hub, Sun Central, the South African Hall of Fame Powered by Samsung opened in November 2015. A legacy project, it is the first of its kind in South Africa to acknowledge and celebrate South Africans who have achieved greatness across fields such as sport, the arts, culture, science and technology. Sun Central is the new home of Sun City entertainment. It consists of two levels of family entertainment. On the ground level, visitors can expect a variety of restaurants, retail outlets and entertainment for the whole family. Sun City’s famous Superbowl has also been reinvented to host action-packed shows and concerts. The South African Hall of Fame is located in this precinct.  Previous inductees include Lucas Radebe, Penny Heyns, Jomo Sono, Jody Scheckter, Jacob Matlala, Brian Mitchell and Zola Budd-Pieterse.
