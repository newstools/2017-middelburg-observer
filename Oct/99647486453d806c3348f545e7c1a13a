 Summer always seems to make people want to focus on their health. It propels us to want to look our best, change our lifestyle, enjoy life and get rid of bad habits. These life hacks could be a great start to your summer:  Insects such as mosquitoes and biting flies don’t like the way the Vitamin B Complex makes you smell to them. Spray a little bit of deodorant on an itchy insect bite and it will stop the itch.  Skipping for 10-15 minutes a day will burn at least 200 calories. This makes jumping one of the best and most efficient form of cardio.   Grapefruit, watermelon, berries, hot peppers, green tea, eggs, fish, coffee, oatmeal, Greek yogurt all help to burn fat.  Are summer nights too hot for you to sleep? Take your sheets, fold them up and put them in a freezer for a few minutes. You’ll be sleeping on a cool surface at least for a while.  If you’re feeling too hot, run your wrist under cold tap water for at least 5 minutes. This will cool you down.
