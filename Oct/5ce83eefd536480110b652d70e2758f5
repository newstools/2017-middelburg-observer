 Vets will be available at several points in Middelburg for animals to be vaccinated over the next two weeks. James Erasmus, an animal health technician involved in the vaccination programme, says that it is important for cats and dogs to be vaccinated on a yearly basis. Yearly vaccinations can also help pets to build up immunity against the disease. Rabies is an extremely dangerous disease that can be fatal to humans. It can be transmitted to domestic animals through infected wild animals like mongooses and meerkats who often venture into residential areas. Mr Erasmus says that such a vaccination at a private vet will cost an estimated R250.   Photo: agriculture.gov.au   The vaccination points are: Monday 9 October 10:00 – 16:00 Tosca Centre Kanonkop 10:00 – 16:00 Kanonkop Spar   Tuesday 10 October 10:00 – 16:00 Midwater Centre 10:00 – 16:00 Aerorand Old Friendly Grocer Centre   Thursday 12 October 10:00 – 16:00 Mineralia OK Grocer Centre 10:00 – 16:00 Nasaret Clinic   Monday 16 October 10:00 – 16:00 State Vet office (Near SPCA) 10:00 – 16:00 Extension 18 park and playground   Wednesday 18 October 10:00 – 17:00 Alzu Depot at Middelburg Mall
