 The fire in Extension 6, Mhluzi, was discovered by neighbors. It is said to have started shortly after 21:00 last night. An eyewitness said that he saw a soldier from 4 S.A.I in Middelburg, arriving at a house in Extension 6 minutes before the fire started. The soldier, believed to be the deceased woman’s boyfriend, arrived in a minibus belonging to the South African National Defense Force (SANDF).    Shortly thereafter the witness heard his parents yell that there was a fire. He rushed to help. It was his neighbor’s house, where the soldier arrived earlier, that was engulfed in flames. Community members helped douse the flames whilst the soldier reportedly walked around, seemingly in a daze, in the street in front of the house. Two girls, aged 10 and 17, were declared dead on the scene. One of the girls’ bodies were discovered outside the house between where the minibus was parked and the front door. It is believed that a blast threw her body there. Their mother (39) was taken to hospital where she passed away during the early morning hours of today. The minibus, belonging to 4 S.A.I. as well as the entire house, were destroyed in the fire.  According to bystanders, the soldier requested on the scene to be taken to his military base.
