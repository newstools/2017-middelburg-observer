Hagai Sitbon, a photographer for the OurWildWorld YouTube channel, is currently working as a volunteer at Ubhetyan-o-Africa.    He set up his GoPro camera in the lion camp during Sunday’s lion feed to capture the carnivores eating. What Hagai did not expect was that an inquisitive lioness would later come and ‘steal’ his camera. The lioness took the GoPro into the lion camp where it was later retrieved with the help of a 4×4 vehicle.
