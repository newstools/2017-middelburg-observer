For the first time since the start of the tennis league, a school from Mhluzi has entered to participate in the Nkangala Tennis League.After two years of training with the KPM Academy of Tennis, the Mphanama High School tennis players are looking forward to the challenge of competing in the game of tennis.But poverty is threatening to put an end to the dream. For many families struggling to make sure their children have something to eat, luxuries like shoes are not even an option. This is the first time a school from the township is entering into the league. But many kids quit tennis because they do not have shoes to play with, tennis coach Phathizwe Mabuza told www.mobserver.co.za. He has appealed to the community of Middelburg to help sixteen Mphanama tennis players with shoes, so they can face their opponents on the court. The league starts this Friday.The shoe sizes are: Boys size 8 (one pair) Boys size 6 (five pairs) Boys size 4 (one pair) Boys size 5 (one pair) Girls size 5 (one pair) Girls size 4 (two pairs) Girls size 3 (five pairs)Anyone willing to sponsor shoes can get in contact with Phathizwe Mabuza on 083 585 0813.
