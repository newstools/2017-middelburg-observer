The resurfacing created traffic congestion last week in Walter Sisulu and Cowen Ntuli Street, where only one lane was open at a time.Temporary Stop/Go points were also set-up along Verdoorn Street as the roadworks progressed.The Steve Tshwete Municipality stated this week that several roads around town were being resurfaced and that the project will continue until the end of June.A full list of all streets to be affected will be published on www.mobserver.co.za
