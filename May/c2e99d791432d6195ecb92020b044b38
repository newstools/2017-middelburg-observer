With tears running down her cheeks, Centre Manager Karen Loesch, said that they have no sugar, no meat, no veggies, no bread, and she simply cannot run the centre. We are in a dire situation, and at this rate we have no choice but to shut down on Friday .Unless they receive help really fast, the more than 40 special needs children will be without a centre to attend during the day which gives them a sense of purpose.Read previous story: Video: Critical shortage of funds at disabilty centreTwo weeks ago we reported that a critical shortage of funds at the Greater Middelburg Activity Centre for the disabled in Meyer Street is threatening the services of a group of volunteer teachers and specifically funds to pay Mr Jean-Paul Ndebele, who is a sign language and braille teacher.Now the situation has worsened, and the centre could shut down due to insufficient resources to feed one meal a day to the children.To assist the centre, contact Ms Karen Loesch on 082 341 6195.
