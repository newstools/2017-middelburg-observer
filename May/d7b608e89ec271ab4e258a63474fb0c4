The industry provides many job opportunities and thus many livelihoods are sustained. Many small businesses have also been created out of liquor trading.The department acknowledges all the economic spinoffs that come with the industry but at the same time it cannot turn a blind eye on devastating consequences that come with the irresponsible and illegal trading of alcohol.Many families have suffered immensely due to alcohol abuse and underage drinking. Some became victims of either through domestic violence and crime committed by people who abuse alcohol.Others have paid with their lives due to road crashes that occurred as a result of drinking and driving.It is in this context that a second Liquor Traders Workshop is taking place in Steve Tshwete Local Municipality this week. The municipality, which includes Middelburg, Hendrina, Doornkop and Zamokuhle, has about 350 taverns.The owners of the taverns are expected to form part of the workshop. They are also expected to make presentations on the challenges that they encounter as players in the industry.During the workshop, the Mpumalanga Liquor Authority, SAPS and the Department of Community Safety, Security and Liaison will make presentations on responsible liquor trading and this is expected to assist with ensuring that the traders and those wishing to trade comply with prevailing legislation and applicable policies.Mpumalanga Community Safety, Security and Liaison, MEC Pat Ngomane, will deliver a keynote address.
