Ralston Smith, a businessman connected with Lahleni Lakes, has denied that he has resigned as a director of Lahleni or Finishing Touch, and maintains that he is still a director and majority shareholder of both Lahleni and Finishing Touch.He stated to the Middelburg Observer that he has provided CIPC with a forensic report that concluded that the signatures used to put his resignation into effect as a director of Finishing Touch were &#8220;without any doubt, not authentic writing, but a forgery&#8221;.&#8220;I also provided CIPC with an affidavit setting out that the signatures used to effect my resignation as a director of Lahleni were forgeries. I have also pointed out to the court that a criminal case of fraud has been opened with Middelburg SAPS, &#8221; he said in a statement.Lahleni Lakes is responsible for a stalled R485 million golf estate development between Middelburg and eMalahleni, with an Ernie Els designed golf course. The concept was launched several years ago, but to date, the land remains untouched despite large investments by debenture holders.General Manager of Lahleni Lakes, Peet Erasmus, previously dismissed contents of a previous report that Mr Joe Singh allegedly forged former associate Ralston Smith&#8217;s signature on a resignation letter, quitting as a director in the company. At the time, Erasmus said this was untrue, sensationalist, and slanderous. and that the &#8216;fraudulent resignation&#8217; of Smith on Finishing Touch was being investigated.When contacted for comment this week along with questions, Erasmus said that they had no comment on the matter as it was before the courts. &#8220;A court date has been confirmed,&#8221; Erasmus said.&#8220;Through my attorneys, I have made an application to dismiss Mr Singh&#8217;s attempt to stop CIPC from doing their full investigation on him. If I am successful the case will be dismissed with costs on an attorney and client scale, and such costs are to be paid by Singh and One Vision,&#8221; said Smith.He also made it clear that he does not seek a cost order against Lahleni or Finishing Touch &#8220;as these are still my companies,&#8221; he said.The court date is believed to be in November this year.
