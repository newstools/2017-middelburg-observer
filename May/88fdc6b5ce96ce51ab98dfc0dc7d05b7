Mr Calvin Sithole (56) left from Nelspruit three weeks ago for a job opportunity in Middelburg.According to his family it was the last time they heard of him. His cell phone is also off and he did not pitch at the company for the interview.He came to Middelburg with his white Isuzu bakkie (registration number XWW055MP) and the vehicle is also missing.The family received information from someone in Rockdale that they have seen a man who fits Mr Sithole&#8217;s description walking in the streets. When they tried to talk to him, he was nonresponsive.This is why the family is of the oppinion that he may have sustained a head injury causing memoryloss.He had a ZCC-badge on his clothes the last time they saw him.If anyone recognises Mr Sithole, please call his wife, Buyisile, at 076 654 3719 or William Makhubu at 064 701 5280.
