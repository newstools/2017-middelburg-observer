In a landmark decision, the Supreme Court of Appeal has ruled that municipalities can no longer demand that sellers of property pay for rates, fees and charges for months in advance before a rates clearance certificate can be issued.Until now the deeds office in South Africa needed a rates clearance certificate to prove that outstanding municipality bills had been paid before the registrar could transfer a property. The landmark case dealt with Nelson Mandela municipality and a private investment company, Amber Mountain Investments. The municipality demanded that Amber Mountain Investments pay R1 million in advance for rates before the sale of their property could go through.The seller argued it was liable only for rates and taxes up to the date of transfer and not thereafter.Sellers can now refuse to pay rates and charges in advance beyond the date of the certificate when applying for a rates clearance certificate.&nbsp;Source: BusinessTechLooking for that dream property in Middelburg.
