One of the many forms Old Joe has taken over the yearsThere s a silent, colourful sentinel that watches over the N4 highway near Schoemanskloof, and his is a story that dates back nearly a century.Old Joe, a painted rock situated on the roadside along Patatanek Pass, is a familiar sight for those who travel between Machadodorp and Nelspruit.The old rock was named after Joe Barabas, the foreman who supervised construction of the first road through Schoemanskloof in 1927.Workers discovered the rock and immediately thought it bore a likeness to Barabas.They erected it alongside the road, painted it and named it Joe, in honour of the dedication he showed in ensuring construction went ahead quickly and without any major hitches.Over the years, Joe has had many facelifts as his look changes to commemorate local events or big happenings in South Africa.The layer of paint that now coats him is more than 5mm thick, with each new look often applied by schoolchildren and local residents.So next time you drive through Patatanek Pass, look out for the New Middelburg Observer Joe.
