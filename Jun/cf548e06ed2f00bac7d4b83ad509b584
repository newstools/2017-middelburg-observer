He says he has been traumatised by the experience and cannot sleep at night, but is grateful that he wasn&#8217;t harmed during the ordeal.He went to visit a friend at Chromeville flats and says that he noticed a Toyota double cab bakkie following him, but didn&#8217;t give it too much attention.&#8220;As soon as I parked my car, three armed men rushed towards me, opened the car, jumped inside and forced me into the back. They threatened to kill me if I looked at them or if I tried to escape,&#8221; he said.The suspects, who appeared to be professional criminals, immediately set up a signal jammer to block the tracker and drove on the Loskop road. They became agitated at the Stop/Go and eventually turned at the dirt road towards Dennilton just after Loskop.It was here that they met up with a Toyota double cab, where another two armed men appeared. They stripped the dashboard and removed the tracker from the Ford Ranger Wildtrak.But they weren&#8217;t satisfied and demanded cash and bank cards with pins from Mr Mokgoroane.The men then drove towards a remote part of KwaMhlanga, where they told Mr Mokgoroane they were now taking his car and he could ask for help from one of the houses in the area.&#8220;It was a very rural area and the time was 23:00. People didn&#8217;t want to open their doors because they were scared. Eventually, one lady opened her window and called the police. I was taken to KwaMhlanga Police Station where I called my brother and returned to Middelburg at 02:00&#8221;.Mr Mokgoroane says that he is grateful that he was unharmed and has opened a case at the Mhluzi Police Station.His car, an orange Ford Ranger Wildtrak with personalised number plates, is now being searched for by police.
