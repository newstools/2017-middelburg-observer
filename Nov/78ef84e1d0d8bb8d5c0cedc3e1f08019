 Walt Disney is once again bringing the beloved story of The Lion King to life featuring an all-star cast that consists of Beyonce, John Kani and James Earl Jones amongst others. Jungle Book director Jon Favreau is at the helm of the live-action production. The 1994 animated film set in Africa follows the adventures of the young lion Simba and his father Mufasa who has to deal with Simba’s wicked uncle, Scar. The Lion King (1994) is one of the biggest animated films of all time with a lifetime global box office gross of $968.8 million, including $422.8 million domestically. It won Academy Awards for the original song Can You Feel the Love Tonight (Elton John, Tim Rice) and original score (Hans Zimmer), plus two Grammy Awards, with the soundtrack selling over 14 million copies. The Minister of Arts and Culture Nathi Mthethwa congratulated Kani and tweeted:  In 1997, the stage production The Lion King made its Broadway debut, winning six Tony Awards. Two decades later, it remains one of Broadway’s biggest hits alongside several other productions running around the world in London, Hamburg, Tokyo, Madrid, Mexico City, Shanghai, Canada and the USA. Translated into eight different languages, its 23 global productions have been seen by more than 85 million people across every continent except Antarctica. The Lion King is the highest grossing film ever. Kani is a creative powerhouse in South Africa having played roles in big blockbusters such as Captain America: Civil War and will reprise the same role in the upcoming Marvel Comics film Black Panther.
