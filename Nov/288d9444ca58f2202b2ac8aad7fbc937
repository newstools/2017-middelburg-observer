Dries van Dyk says that he initially bought a couple of coffins to convert into display cabinets to sell at his business.  On 19 October, thieves poisoned his dogs and gained entry to his garage. They were greeted by a stack of coffins, which he believes caused them to flee without stealing anything. Mr Van Dyk decided to put one of the coffins in front of his house to ward off criminals. He has since been accused of being a satanist. “I am not a satanist simply because I have a coffin outside my house.”  He converts coffins into display cabinets by replacing the wooden lids with glass and customising the inside according to client requirements. Smaller coffins are also converted into coffee tables. A coffin with a skull inside is also used at his business to scare off criminals. Odds & All in Cowen Ntuli Street has been broken into numerous times. That is until Mr Van Dyk put up the coffin. The skull works with motion sensors, triggering flashing red lights in its eyes.  Even the prostitutes who used to hang out in front of his business at night, scramble when the skull’s eyes light up at night, Mr Van Dyk says.
