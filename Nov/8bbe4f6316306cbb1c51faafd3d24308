 Initial reports, circulated on safety groups and even by the Witbank CPF, said that G4S guards were killed on the scene. This information is incorrect. According to witnesses on the scene, guards were injured, but mainly because of the fight with robbers who pulled them out of the vehicle to get to the money. Motorists planning on using the Old Witbank Road can expect delays. The road however is said to be open for traffic at the moment.   Blood trail ends in Gauteng Guard shot in head during transit robbery Weather for the week Super Sport United team stuck on N4 after convoy crash Add us on WhatsApp. Save the number 072 248 3855 on your phone and send a WhatsApp message with the words “Add me” to receive news broadcasts.
