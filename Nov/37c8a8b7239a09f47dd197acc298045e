The recently re-opened Dros Restaurant went up in flames on Saturday afternoon shortly after 15:00 – causing millions of rands worth of damages.    It is suspected that an electrical fault in the ceiling was the cause of the fire, but nothing has yet been confirmed.   The fire also spread to the roof of the Middelburg Chamber of Commerce and Industry offices.  Fire Brigades from the muncipality and Columbus responded to the scene and managed to douse the flames before further damage was sustained.  There were no immediate reports of any injuries.
