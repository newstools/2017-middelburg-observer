 Their victims more often than not, end up in hospital after the ordeal. The women, who frequent shebeens just before closing time, target the drivers of luxury vehicles, travelling alone.      They ask for a lift and later seduce their target to end up at his house or a hotel room. There they drug him before robbing him of his valuables and vehicle. Victims were targeted in Middelburg as well as The Ridge Casino, KwaNdebele and eMalahleni. Police are looking for the help of the public to apprehend them.  If you recognise them or have any information that can help with the investigation, contact constable Sikhosana of the police’s Anti Corruption Unit in Middelburg on 072 587 6512.
