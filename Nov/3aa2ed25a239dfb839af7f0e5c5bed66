    Both accused are applying for bail. Protesters outside court demands that bail be denied, Rekord East reports. Potgieter and Dumas were arrested in September after they allegedly tied a 10 year-old girl to a tree, assaulted her and held her at gunpoint. The girl claimed that she and friends went for a jog with their dogs when their animals strayed. Whilst looking for their dogs they suddenly heard gunshots. Her friends managed to escape but she was captured. Potgieter claims that the children and their dogs were on his farm to hunt springbok. He said that this was not the first time people hunted on his farm without permission. Read original story by Rekord East here.
