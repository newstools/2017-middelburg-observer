 Many drivers opted to cross the embankment, which consisted of a V-shaped water drain. Vehicles were scratched and even almost toppled when they crossed it. Other drivers waited on the side of the road for the scene to be cleared. Soccer players from Supersport United were among the curious crowd of onlookers who stood around the accident scene. Former Bafana Bafana goalkeeper Andre Arendse, New Zealand international Jeremy Brockie, and crowd favourite Bradley Grobler were instantly recognised. What followed was a steady stream of fans requesting photos, selfies and friendly banter. Amidst the shouts to say ‘Cheeeeese’ and also ‘Chieeeeeeefs’ for the camera, players enjoyed a few social moments and laughter on the sidelines of what was otherwise a depressing scene.
