 Researchers from Duke University in Durham, North Carolina in the US, may have discovered a new way of killing cancer cells. The team was jointly led by Dr. Matthias Gromeier, a professor in the Department of Neurosurgery, and Prof. Smita Nair, who is an immunologist in the Department of Surgery. The new research – which is published in the journal Science Translational Medicine – shows how a modified poliovirus enables the body to use its own resources to fight off cancer. The modified virus has been named PVS-RIPO. PVS-RIPO has been in clinical trials since 2011 and preliminary results have offered hope to patients with one of the most aggressive forms of brain tumour: recurrent glioblastoma. T cells attack a cancer cell.
